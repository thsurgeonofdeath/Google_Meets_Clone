# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Technologies I used

- React for front-end of our app
- Simple Express.js server
- Socket.IO as signaling server
- Vanilla js to manage video elements
- WebRTC
- Simple-peer library
